Simple calculator with GUI

A simple calculator made with a GUI interface to facilitate the user usage. It has the basic operations (sum, subtraction, division and multiplication) and three more operations, squared, square root, and "one divided by".

## known issues ##
There are some bugs if you start messing around too much with functions like the sqrt (float functions in general).
I will soon upload a scientific calculator, and in this version, i believe this problem will be fixed.
